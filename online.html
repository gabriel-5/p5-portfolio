                <p class="project-title">——Please Call </p>
                <p class="project-info">  Basic idea for the frontend of a new social media site intended to sit somewhere between a communal Twitter feed and lonely hearts listings. Anyone lonely can post their name, message and a phone number for strangers to call them up. Likely fundamentally unusable but potentially interesting outcomes. </p>

                <p class="project-title">——Skid Tiller </p>
                <p class="project-info">Rough prototype for a planned multimedia text-adventure being developed in
                    collaboration with a writer/artist. I will be designing the mechanics, composing the soundtrack and
                    doing a portion of the writing while my collaborator will cover the bulk of the narrative - which
                    will be themed around body horror and experiences of gender - as they
                    begin an artist residency October 2021. This was
                    a quick build created as a tone-setting exercise. </p>

                <p class="project-title">——Carter Family Fan-Site</p>
                <p class="project-info">Framed as a fan page for the country music group The Carter Family and visually
                    modelled after historic video game fanpages, this website
                    was designed as part of a larger project about fictionalised country-music histories, obsessive
                    fandom and the internet. The content is almost entirely fictional, and the framing device of the
                    Carter Family is used as a backdrop to create a series of short, throwaway musical compositions
                    that I will continue to add to as an ongoing project. </p>

                <p class="project-title">——King's Field Personality Test</p>
                <p class="project-info">Multiple-choice quiz website which tells the user which NPC from the video game
                    King's Field (1994) is their "personality type". The page is supposed to be aesthetically
                    reminiscent of old flash games, and I also based the sound design in memories of playing these.

                <p class="project-title">——Churchy</p>
                <p class="project-info">Short video game made in the Sword of Moonlight engine. The game was created
                    with
                    the intent of directing music video inside it, with the characters in the game speaking the lyrics
                    to the song. </p>
